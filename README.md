# RandomMusician

This is a simple side project which generates a sequence of random notes from a major scale and plays them back.

Built using Python and it's libraries.

This is far from a perfect music generator or composition tool. However, as someone who isn't a musician or proficient with music editing software, this project was a fun opportunity to try to learn and explore the most basic of sound manipulations in Python.

## What Does it Do?

RandomMusician randomly selects a variable number of notes from a major scale, each associated with a specific frequency or piano .wav file, and plays them back using sound files. The result is a unique melody of your desired size every time you run the script.
You can choose to use piano sound files or frequencies.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need Python and a few packages installed:

- Numpy
- Sounddevice
- Pydub

You can install these with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice pydub
```

Then, clone this repository, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash

python main.py
```
## Contributing

If you're interested in sound and music generation and have some ideas on how to improve this project, feel free to suggest changes or make a pull request. I'm always willing to learn.

## A Note of Caution

Please keep your volume at a reasonable level before running the script. The generated sounds might be louder than expected.
## License

This project is open-source, available under the MIT License.


Enjoy experimenting with the sounds!
